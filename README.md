# Lunch ðŸŽ²

Don't know where to eat? Let the power of random pick a place for you.

Rulls are simple:
* anyone can roll for a lunch place
* one re-roll per person per week is allowed

Slack commands:

* `/roll` - to roll for a lunch place
* `/add <place>` - to add a new place
* `/list` - to see added places
